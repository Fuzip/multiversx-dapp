# MultiversX dApp

This app is a very simple decentralized application that will allow the user to deposit a specific number of tokens (default is 1 xEGLD) to a smart contract address and to lock them for a specific amount of time (default is 10 minutes). After this time interval passes, the user can claim back the same amount of tokens. Sending funds to the contract is called ping. Claiming the same amount back is called pong.
